# Puja Vidhi

Welcome to the Puja Vidhi repository!

## Purpose

This repository is dedicated to hosting content related to our family puja procedures. Our goal is to make these procedures easily accessible to everyone in the family, regardless of their location, as long as they have access to the internet.

Here, you will find detailed instructions, rituals, and guidelines for performing various pujas. We hope this will help preserve our traditions and ensure that everyone can participate in these important ceremonies.

## Testing using http-server

Here are the commands to install and run http-server locally:

Install http-server:

# OPTIONAL # sudo apt install npm
npm install -g http-server

This will start a local server and provide you with a URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8080) that you can open in your browser to access your index.html file.
