# Puja Vidhi

Welcome to the Puja Vidhi repository!

## Purpose

This repository is dedicated to hosting content related to our family puja procedures. Our goal is to make these procedures easily accessible to everyone in the family, regardless of their location, as long as they have access to the internet.

## Content

Here, you will find detailed instructions, rituals, and guidelines for performing various pujas. We hope this will help preserve our traditions and ensure that everyone can participate in these important ceremonies.

## Testing using http-server

Here are the commands to install and run http-server locally:

Install http-server:
```
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```

This will start a local server and provide you with a URL (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8080) that you can open in your browser to access your index.html file.

## Contributions

If you have any suggestions or additional content to add, please feel free to contribute by creating a pull request or contacting the repository maintainers.

Thank you for being a part of our family traditions!
