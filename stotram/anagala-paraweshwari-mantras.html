    <h2>Tale of Angala Parameshwari</h2>

    <p>Long ago, in the sacred heights of Kailasa, Goddess Parvathi awaited Lord Shiva’s return. From afar, she saw a
        radiant five-headed figure approach. Believing it to be her husband, she rose with folded hands.</p>

    <p>But it was not Shiva. It was Brahma, the creator.</p>

    <p>Amused at her mistake, Brahma’s pride swelled. With a mocking smile, he said, “Did you think I was Shiva? What
        can you do? I too have five heads, just as he does.”</p>

    <p>His arrogance, comparing himself to Shiva and insulting Parvathi, pierced her heart with shame and anger.</p>

    <h3>The Breaking of Brahma’s Head</h3>

    <p>When Shiva returned, Parvathi told him of Brahma’s insult. “My Lord, Brahma dares mock you as his equal. Break
        one of his heads—such pride cannot go unpunished.”</p>

    <p>Shiva’s eyes blazed. “So be it.” With one strike of divine fury, he severed a head from Brahma.</p>

    <p>At once, Saraswati, Brahma’s consort, appeared in fury. “You have slain a Brahmin, Shiva. For this, you are
        cursed! The severed head shall cling to your hand, never leaving you. It will consume all offerings placed
        before you, leaving you hungry. You shall wander the cremation grounds, haunted by <em>Brahmahati dosha</em>.”
    </p>

    <p>Her gaze then fell upon Parvathi. “And you, daughter of the mountain, urged this act. You too are
        cursed—homeless, cast from luxury, you shall wander the forests and mud, stripped of comfort.”</p>

    <p>Bound by these curses, Shiva and Parvathi parted in sorrow—he roaming the burning grounds with Brahma’s skull
        stuck to his palm, she searching for a place of penance in the wilderness.</p>

    <h3>Parvathi’s Wandering</h3>

    <p>Parvathi wandered endlessly. Every grove seemed unfit, every path heavy with despair. At last, she found a
        wondrous forest—lush, fragrant, filled with flowers and streams. Her heart rejoiced. Here she would remain. The
        waters became her sacred temple tank.</p>

    <p>Taking the form of a five-headed serpent, she hid within an anthill, unseen, preparing for austerities.</p>

    <h3>The Fisherman and the King</h3>

    <p>One day, a fisherman passed by. Seeing her in human form, he asked in fear, “Mother, are you preparing for puja?
        Beware! Our king, Malaiarasan, forbids worship. Any who pray are executed. Please, leave before he finds you.”
    </p>

    <p>Parvathi smiled serenely. “This earth is mine. What power has your king over me?”</p>

    <p>Still trembling, the fisherman begged again. But before his eyes, Parvathi merged into the anthill. Realizing she
        was no ordinary woman, he whispered the truth: “She is Adi Parashakti.” Word spread, and villagers gathered in
        awe.</p>

    <p>The news reached King Malaiarasan. Enraged, he ordered the anthill destroyed. Soldiers flattened it, scattering
        its soil. Yet the fisherman preserved a handful of the sacred earth. When he returned it, the anthill
        miraculously rose again, step by step, immense and unyielding.</p>

    <p>Furious, the king commanded its ruin once more. But his men, terrified, refused. In anger, Malaiarasan himself
        pointed at the anthill—only for his arm to freeze. His hand withered, lifeless.</p>

    <p>Terrified, he cried out, “Forgive me, Mother! This grove belongs to you alone!”</p>

    <p>Moved by his surrender, the Devi revealed her divine form, blazing yet compassionate, granting darshan to the
        king and the people.</p>

    <h3>Vishnu’s Counsel and the Ritual</h3>

    <p>Still burdened by Saraswati’s curse, Shiva and Parvathi turned to their protector, Vishnu. As Parvathi’s brother,
        he spoke with compassion: “Sister, here in Melmalayanur lies your release. Prepare a sacred meal in three parts:
        two for Kabalam, and one dropped upon the ground. When Kabalam stoops to eat, reveal your fierce form and
        destroy him. Only then will the curse lift.”</p>

    <p>Lakshmi and Amudha Surabhi aided Parvathi in preparing the food, while Ganesha guarded Shiva.</p>

    <p>At the appointed time, Parvathi carried out the ritual. As Kabalam bent to taste the scattered food, she assumed
        her fierce form as <strong>Angala Parameshwari</strong>. With a mighty stamp of her right foot, she crushed him,
        destroying arrogance and lifting the <em>Brahmahati dosha</em>.</p>

    <p>At that moment, the skull that clung to Shiva’s palm fell and was buried beneath the temple grounds.</p>

    <p>Shiva, relieved, declared, “Here, where the curse was broken, a Shiva linga shall be established.”</p>

    <p>Thus it was. Parvathi remained in her fierce, protective form—revered as Angala Parameshwari of Melmalayanur.</p>

    <h3>The Living Anthill</h3>

    <p>Her first devotees were the humble fishermen, who built her temple. To this day, the anthill continues to grow
        layer by layer, defying time.</p>

    <p>Here, the Devi appears fierce-eyed and formidable, yet smiling with compassion. Her favorite offering is a
        garland of lemons or limes, and countless families revere her as their <strong>kuladeivam</strong>, their
        guardian deity.</p>

    <p>Though wrathful against evil, to her children she is ever the nurturing mother—protective, gentle, and kind.</p>


    <h2>What to Ask the Goddess and How</h2>

    <p>Devotees may seek the blessings of the Devi for many needs—such as children, employment, good health, relief from
        mental distress, or freedom from afflictions like madness, <em>billi</em> (black magic spell or sorcery attack),
        <em>shoonyam</em> (magical draining or curse to empty prosperity/energy), <em>yaeval</em> (dispatch of harm),
        <em>paeyee</em> (ghosts or sprits), or <em>pisachu</em> (demons).
    </p>

    <p>As part of your prayer, offer a <strong>garland of 18, 21, 54, or 108 lemons</strong> to the Goddess.</p>

    <h3>Auspicious Times for Prayer</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Friday</strong> between <strong>9:00 am and 10:00 am</strong> is considered especially powerful.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Tuesday</strong> is also an appropriate day to worship.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>During this time, speak openly to the Devi about your difficulties, as if confiding in a mother. Many devotees
        also take a vow to visit the temple regularly for <strong>27 consecutive weeks</strong>. Often, their prayers
        are answered even before completing the full period.</p>

    <p>One of the most important events connected with the Goddess is the <strong>Mayaana Kolla festival</strong>, which
        is celebrated on a grand scale.</p>


    <h2>How to perform Puja, during Aadi month?</h2>

    <p>If you have the practice of offering <strong>Koozhu</strong> on Sundays, prepare it as <strong>naivedyam</strong>
        for the Devi and then share it with the members of your household.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Begin by offering <strong>bangles</strong> to the Goddess.</li>
        <li>Place a small <strong>stool</strong> and decorate it with <strong>turmeric, kumkum, or rangoli</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>Spread a <strong>red cloth</strong> on the stool (red is auspicious for both Devi and Lakshmi).</li>
        <li>Place the <strong>naivedyam</strong> in a pot.</li>
        <li>On a leaf, place <strong>tamboolam, fruits, and a lemon garland</strong>.</li>
        <li>Set the <strong>Koozhu pot</strong> on the same leaf.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Perform the puja in the usual manner. During the worship, recite the <strong>stotram</strong> <em>9, 27, 54, or
            108 times</em> according to your devotion.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This puja is traditionally performed in the <strong>evening</strong>.</p>
